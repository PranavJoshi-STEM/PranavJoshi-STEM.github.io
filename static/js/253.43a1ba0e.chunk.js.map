Naturally, I found \r\nthe opportunity to get volunteer hours; however, instead of publicising a candidate,\r\nI found it to be much more interesting if I would've created a website for one.  On my city's official website,\r\nit has a list of candidates including their email, ward, name and website (if provided).  After finding this out,\r\nI contacted several candidates who didn't have a website and asked if I could volunteer to give them a free website.\r\nWhile most of them declined, a woman named Carla Green emailed me back and we started work on the website.  After I showed her wire-frames \r\n(the layout of the website) on Google Slides, I proceded to actually create it on Weebly.  After several hours of work,\r\nI was finally able to complete it and the current version is linked below.  This was so much fun and definitely worth it\r\nas I expanded my resume and got volunteer hours!`\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default details_01_09_2022;;"],"names":[],"sourceRoot":""}
