Originally, I wanted to create it on Weebly due to my familiarity and using the service. \n\tHowever, I soon realised how rigid and buggy it was; I wanted to code simple CSS cards with box-shadows \n\tand that took several hours! Thinking through it, I decided to download the website and work on\n\tit from my MacBook. Looking back, this was definitely the right choice as I learned HTML, was \n\table to get more control over the website, and was able to keep a copy of the website with me.\n\tTo host the website and get a domain, I used GitHub Pages due to it being free, quick to modify, \n\treliable and promotion-free. While this website needs more touch-up like mobile-support or \n\tanimations, I'm really happy with the current result; I've spent more than 15 hours coding this! \n\tI can't wait to fill this with more content and features!"}}}]);
