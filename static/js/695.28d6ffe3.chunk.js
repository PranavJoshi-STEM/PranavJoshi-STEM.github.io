While chatting at her apartment, a brief idea sparked \n\tup. I would get a tour outside of University Waterloo (my dream school) to see what \n\tit's like. When I walked through the campus, I couldn't believe my eyes; all the \n\tbuildings were giant and FUTURISTIC!!! Additionally, the campus was so big that a train \n\tran through it so students could go from building-to-building faster (which were several \n\tminutes on foot). When I asked some of my sister's friends who have been through some \n\tUW engineering buildings, they said that it was even more tech-filled on the inside! \n\tNow, it's only a matter of time before I could attend the virtual tours coming in \n\tthe future."}}}]);
