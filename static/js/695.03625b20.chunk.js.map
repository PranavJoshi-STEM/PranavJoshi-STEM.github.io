While chatting at her apartment, a brief idea sparked \r\n\tup. I would get a tour outside of University Waterloo (my dream school) to see what \r\n\tit's like. When I walked through the campus, I couldn't believe my eyes; all the \r\n\tbuildings were giant and FUTURISTIC!!! Additionally, the campus was so big that a train \r\n\tran through it so students could go from building-to-building faster (which were several \r\n\tminutes on foot). When I asked some of my sister's friends who have been through some \r\n\tUW engineering buildings, they said that it was even more tech-filled on the inside! \r\n\tNow, it's only a matter of time before I could attend the virtual tours coming in \r\n\tthe future.`\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default details_14_07_2024;"],"names":[],"sourceRoot":""}
