Originally, I wanted to create it on Weebly due to my familiarity and using the service. \r\n\tHowever, I soon realised how rigid and buggy it was; I wanted to code simple CSS cards with box-shadows \r\n\tand that took several hours! Thinking through it, I decided to download the website and work on\r\n\tit from my MacBook. Looking back, this was definitely the right choice as I learned HTML, was \r\n\table to get more control over the website, and was able to keep a copy of the website with me.\r\n\tTo host the website and get a domain, I used GitHub Pages due to it being free, quick to modify, \r\n\treliable and promotion-free. While this website needs more touch-up like mobile-support or \r\n\tanimations, I'm really happy with the current result; I've spent more than 15 hours coding this! \r\n\tI can't wait to fill this with more content and features!`\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default details_28_07_2022;"],"names":[],"sourceRoot":""}
