    'description': `· · · (01/09/2022) In my city, we have municipal elections coming up.  
This election determines who becomes city-councilor of my ward.  Naturally, I found 
the opportunity to get volunteer hours; however, instead of publicising a candidate,
I found it to be much more interesting if I would've created a website for one.  On my city's official website,
it has a list of candidates including their email, ward, name and website (if provided).  After finding this out,
I contacted several candidates who didn't have a website and asked if I could volunteer to give them a free website.
While most of them declined, a woman named Carla Green emailed me back and we started work on the website.  After I showed her wire-frames 
(the layout of the website) on Google Slides, I proceded to actually create it on Weebly.  After several hours of work,
I was finally able to complete it and the current version is linked below.  This was so much fun and definitely worth it
as I expanded my resume and got volunteer hours!`
