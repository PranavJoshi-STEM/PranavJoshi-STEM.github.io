	website. Originally, I wanted to create it on Weebly due to my familiarity and using the service. 
	However, I soon realised how rigid and buggy it was; I wanted to code simple CSS cards with box-shadows 
	and that took several hours! Thinking through it, I decided to download the website and work on
	it from my MacBook. Looking back, this was definitely the right choice as I learned HTML, was 
	able to get more control over the website, and was able to keep a copy of the website with me.
	To host the website and get a domain, I used GitHub Pages due to it being free, quick to modify, 
	reliable and promotion-free. While this website needs more touch-up like mobile-support or 
	animations, I'm really happy with the current result; I've spent more than 15 hours coding this! 
	I can't wait to fill this with more content and features!`
