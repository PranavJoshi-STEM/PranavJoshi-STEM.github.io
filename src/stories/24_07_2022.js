    'descripion': `· · ·(24/07/2022) Over the weekend, my family and I visited my sister who 
	studies at the City of Waterloo. While chatting at her apartment, a brief idea sparked 
	up. I would get a tour outside of University Waterloo (my dream school) to see what 
	it's like. When I walked through the campus, I couldn't believe my eyes; all the 
	buildings were giant and FUTURISTIC!!! Additionally, the campus was so big that a train 
	ran through it so students could go from building-to-building faster (which were several 
	minutes on foot). When I asked some of my sister's friends who have been through some 
	UW engineering buildings, they said that it was even more tech-filled on the inside! 
	Now, it's only a matter of time before I could attend the virtual tours coming in 
	the future.`
